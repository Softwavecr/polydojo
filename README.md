# polydojo

Some sparring in cs, js, py and go. This is informal development, yet I aim to make use of feature branches and PRs.

I am really interested in coding the array functions presented by jrsinclair.com a few years back here [https://jrsinclair.com/javascript-array-methods-cheat-sheet/]. His cheatsheet got stuck in my head as a great resource that I re-visit every time I come across an array problem and in any language. So I intend to implement these functions in the 4 languages mentioned before.

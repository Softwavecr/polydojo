# polydojo

There has been some sparring in CSS, JS, Python, and Go. This is an informal development, yet I aim to use feature branches and PRs.

I am interested in coding the array functions presented by jrsinclair.com a few years ago [https://jrsinclair.com/javascript-array-methods-cheat-sheet/]. His cheatsheet became a great resource that I re-visit every time I come across an array problem in any language. So, I intend to implement these functions in the four languages mentioned before.
